- What is global management in React?
- What is the difference between Number and number for react?
- How component lifecycle works? (componentWillMount, componentDidMount, componentWillUpdate, componentWillUnmount and their relationships with hooks)
- How useEffect works?
- Conditional rendering, how does it work? It is something from React specifically? 
- Dissert on differences between Class components and Function components. I do understand that even the documentation seems to appraise the favor for Function components, but why it is needed to have something like this.function.bind to pass the state into a function if you're on a Class component?
