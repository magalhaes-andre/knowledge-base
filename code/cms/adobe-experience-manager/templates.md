## What is a AEM Template

A template helps by defining a uniform style for the app's pages. It should also specify which components are permitted to be used in a specific scope. It is nothing more than a tree of nodes with the same structure as the page you're building. It is separated from the content itself. 

AEM Offers static and editable templates.

In case of a new page building. You commonly should chose a template that serves as a foundation for the new page. The template in this case specifies the structure of the page, along with any starting content and components that should be default for the case.

In case you're bulding a Content Fragment, the structure, basic elements, and variants are all defined in the template.
