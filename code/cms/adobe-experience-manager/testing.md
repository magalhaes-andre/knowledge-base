# AEM Testing

## What is AEM Testing?

For UI Automated test you'd have the Bobcat testing framework, provided by AEM. This framework works by providing a Javascript API to generate tests, which allows you to write and run UI tests in the web browser directly. It also uses Hobbes.js (javascript testing package). 

Fun fact: _The Hobbes.js package was developed alongside AEM development, and is now available for public usage to test AEM apps._
