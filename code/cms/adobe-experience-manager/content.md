## DAM Definition


## DAM Renditions

Inside the DAM you are allowed to create renditions of an image including different sizes and versions of the same asset. You can use the renditions for creating thumbnails or smaller views of large, heavy images.

If you're aiming for multi-device websites this is essential for optimization.

## CUG

Closed User Group is a way to select a folder in Digital Assets to only be viewable by specific users. 

How to make it: 
- In CQ DAM, right-click the folder you want to add closed user group properties for and select Properties.
- Click the CUG tab.
- Select the Enabled checkbox to make the folder and its assets available only to a closed user group.
- Browse to the login page, if there is one, to add that information. Add admitted groups by clicking Add item. If necessary, add the realm. Click OK to save your changes.
